The security field (after 158 chars barcode length) is a separate field that enables a third party to verify that the bar code data was
not tampered with.
The security field is optional and to be used only when required by the local security
administration. Typically, this field may contain a digital signature of variable length, the length of
the field and a type of security data (that defines the algorithm used). IATA is only providing the
structure for the signature to be stored in the bar code.
The bar code data (mandatory, optional and individual airline use fields) remain unchanged and
can be read regardless of the digital signature.
